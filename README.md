# Undetectable Injector Platform

## Описание
**Undetectable Injector Platform** — This is a project aimed at creating an injection platform that is not detected by antiviruses and anti-cheats. At the current stage, the basic injection functionality has been implemented. In the future, it is planned to add anti-detection mechanisms to increase stealth.

## Возможности
- Injecting DLLs into target processes.
- Using `NtCreateThreadEx` and `CreateRemoteThread` to create threads.
- Logging injection stages for debugging.

## Планы на будущее
- Adding anti-detection mechanisms.
- Improved performance and stability.
- Expanded functionality for working with different types of processes.
